## Jay Lund {inflows:1} Provisional
MWDSC Provided local inflow data from 1974 to 1994. This data was used as is for those years. Other years in the series were filled in by establishing an average inflow by year type, and applying that inflow for each year of that type. Then inflows due to deep percolation of exterior applied water were subtracted. The resulting time series of inflows was too large for the reported basin size, so was scaled down proportionatly to fit in the basin.
