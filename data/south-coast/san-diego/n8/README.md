## Jay Lund {inflows:1} 
MWDSC Provided local inflow data from 1974 to 1994. This data was used as is for those years. Other years in the series were filled in by establishing an average inflow by year type, and applying that inflow for each year of that type. Totals were checked againt San Diego's UWMPs. There is a discrpancy between MWDSC's reporting of San Diego's local supplies, and San Diego's own reporting. We're using MWDCS's numbers.
