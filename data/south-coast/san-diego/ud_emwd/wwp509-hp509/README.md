Proposed expanded recycling facility for EMWD.  Set as 50% of the wastewater return flow for 2050 minus existing recycling capacity (imbedded in Local Supplies TS) of 57.2 taf/yr.  New high cost cap=9.51 taf/yr (MJ Nov 5 2005). Previously for 2100 we used 15.99 taf/mo.   All potable recycling capacity was 9.51, now not active
