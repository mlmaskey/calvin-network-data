## Jay Lund {inflows:1} Draft
MWDSC Provided local inflow data from 1974 to 1994. This data was used as is for those years. Other years in the series were filled in by establishing an average inflow by year type, and applying that inflow for each year of that type. Totals were checked againt San Diego's UWMPs. The inflow amounts supplied to MWDSC were inadequate to meet the 2009 water plan udate's recorded agricultural demands in the region, so ~206 TAF/Yr of groundwater flow was added to meet the demands of private agricultural pumping.
