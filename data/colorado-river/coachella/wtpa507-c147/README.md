rough estimate. Need to be refined.

## Randy Ritzema {amplitude:1} 
The desalting facility has a capacity of 10 mgd. 13.6 mgd of drain ag water would be diverter and filtered prior to desalination. Desalted water for agricultural irrigation. An equal amount of Canal water can be delivered to golf courses. Delivery of desalted water for 2015 under alternative 4 (preferred alt): 8 TAF/y. The difference between the 13.6 mgd in, and the 8 TAF/Y out is made up by the gain factor of 0.44 (SEE C:\Manuel\CALVINRUNS\V29-Basecase\Documentation\unitconversion.xls)
