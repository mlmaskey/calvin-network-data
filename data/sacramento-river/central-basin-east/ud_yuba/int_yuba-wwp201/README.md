## Mimi Jenkins {bounds:1} Final
Based on revised analysis of CVGSM deep percolation and indoor returns, assume no SW return flow from these urban users

## Mimi Jenkins {amplitude:1} Draft
value used to turn off SW return flow (CVGSM all indoor use to GW - most of this area is outside CVPM central valley GW basins so no return flows)
