## Brian Van Lienden {endingstorage:1} Final
Constrained ending storage set to equal initial storage; if setting the ending storage equal to the initial results in an infeasible run, the target persuasion function can be used.  The persuasion function applies a penalty of $1,000,000/AF for ending storages less than the initial storage.

Calculated as slope between the minimum and maximum points from the area-capacity relationship found in the HEC-3 Model input file; Temporarily set at 0 from 0.002602 to re-calibrate in A03B18 with new instream flows mins - obj. to get SR optimized reservoirs to stay full when calibration occurs.
