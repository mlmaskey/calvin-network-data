## Brian Van Lienden {endingstorage:1} Final
Constrained ending storage set to equal initial storage; if setting the ending storage equal to the initial results in an infeasible run, the target persuasion function can be used.  The persuasion function applies a penalty of $1,000,000/AF for ending storages less than the initial storage.
