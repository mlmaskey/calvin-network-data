Revised infrastructure capacity of 620 cfs (A02C10) down to 465 cfs.  Though Foothill and Coast Range Tunnels have a capacity of 620 cfs, the three San Joaquin Pipelines currently in use have a combined capacity of 465 cfs.  The addition of a fourth pipeline will bring the combined capacity to 620 cfs (RR).
