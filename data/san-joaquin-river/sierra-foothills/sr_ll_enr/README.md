## Andy Draper {inflows:1} Final
Corrected and edited for last year extension (WY 1993); using a repeat of 1958 instead of mistaken copy of SR-HHR 1993 values.  Total of SR-HHR, SR-LL-LE, and SR-81 inflows equals SANJASM Inflow TS provided by Peggy Manza, USBR.

## Brian Van Lienden {endingstorage:1} Final
Constrained ending storage set to equal initial storage; if setting the ending storage equal to the initial results in an infeasible run, the target persuasion function can be used.  The persuasion function applies a penalty of $1,000,000/AF for ending storages less than the initial storage.

## Brian Van Lienden {initialstorage:1} Final
Calculated as 50% of maximum storage (up to V43).  V44: Large calibration flows in highly constrained SFPUC system were large, indicating that raising the storage to a higher value might be a more accurate representation.  Initial storage was calculated as the average of the storage outputs from V43 which were below capacity (RR).
