Ending storage can be set to initial storage for alternative model runs (see source file for initial storage calcs).  Target values were used in early CALVIN runs for debugging infeasibilities.  For A02C11, ending GW storage was set equal to the values in A03C46 (Base Case run) for comparison (RR).
