## Andy Draper {amplitude:1} Final
CVPM region-wide return flow calculated from DWR Bulletin 160-98 crop AW & ETAW weighted by projected land use combined with regional reuse.  Corrected in A02C12 from 0.27 to 0.272, due to infeasibilities in Unconstrained Run with ending period GW storage constrained.
