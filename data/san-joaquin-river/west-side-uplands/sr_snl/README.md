## Brian Van Lienden {endingstorage:1} Final
Ending storage for Unconstrained Run set equal to final Base Case run (A03C46).  This keeps overall surface water consistent between two runs.

## Brian Van Lienden {areacapfactor:1} Final
Calculated assuming a linear slope between the minimum and maximum storage and area values. Original value of 0.00613 subsequently corrected to 0.00997 after A03C20 because evaporation is still substantially smaller than DWRSIM run 514 combined for SR-11&12. See Source file for correction calculation (MJ)
