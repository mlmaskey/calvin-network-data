## Stacy Tanaka {costs:1} Final
CCWD has three sources of water, all of which have monthly varying water quality.  The penalty set is to reflect the salinity damage of each source (based on TDS above the maximum) plus the fixed treatement and local distrubtion and conveyance costs ($299/af). REVISED 12-27-2002 MJ, removed local costs so penalty only reflects salinity damage cost. See revised salinity file on Roselyn in folder "G03G07"
