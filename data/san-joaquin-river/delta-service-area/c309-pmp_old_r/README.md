CCWD has three sources of water, all of which have monthly varying water quality.  The penalty set is to reflect the salinity damage of each source (based on TDS above the 250 mg/l at 50 cents/ mg/l TDS) plus the fixed treatement and local distrubtion and conveyance costs ($299/af). REVISED 12-27-2002 MJ - removed $299 from the paired data cost, so it reflects only salinity damage; aslo recomputed see revised file on Roselyn in folder "G03G07"
