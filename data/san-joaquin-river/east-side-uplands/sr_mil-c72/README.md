Infrastructure capacity: 1275 cfs; This constraint is currently turned off in policy 4a because the constrained deliveries on C72_C46 have a monthly maximum of 81.4 TAF, which is greater than the constrained values.  (Note: According to Mark Leu on 6/15/00, the maximum historical monthly delivery on the Madera Canal from 1986-1997 was only 72.7 TAF - based on this, the Policy 4a constrained time series may need to be revisited.)
