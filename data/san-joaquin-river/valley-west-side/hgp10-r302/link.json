  "description": "Sum of maximum historical monthly GW used as water supply source at San Joaquin Basin Action Plan refuges west of the San Joaquin River which includes China Island and Salt Slough from North Grasslands, San Luis unit, West Bear Creek, Frietas and Kesterson from San Luis NWR, Los Banos WA, Volta WA, and Grasslands RCD. Grasslands RCD engaged in a three year pilot project to test viability of GW was water supply source, however, no long term decision was made at the time. This network flow configuration assumed no use of GW within Grasslands RCD to satisfy Level 2 and Level 4 demand.
