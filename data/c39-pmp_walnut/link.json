  "description": "Mokelumen River Aqueduct, both the gravity and the pump capacity.  There is a cost function attached downstream (modified skt 091902). (Mokelumne River Aqueduct diversion to Walnut Creek Pumping Plant.  The Mokelumne River Aqueduct is actually a single pipeline with a gravity feed capacity of 202 MGD, but the \"suction\" pumps increase capacity by 123 MGD.  Thus the parallel link (C39_C201) is the gravity portion of the flow, while this link represents the additional supply that can be delivered due to the pumps.  The value of expansion should be measured based on this link (if it\"s at capacity then the MRA is at capacity).)",
