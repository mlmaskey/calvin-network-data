## Stacy Tanaka {costs:1} Final
CCWD has three sources of water, all of which have monthly varying water quality.  The penalty set is to reflect the salinity damage of each source (based on TDS above the maximum) plus the fixed treatement and local distrubtion and conveyance costs ($299/af). REVISED 12-27-2002, MJ, removed 299 cost from penalty function so it reflects only salinity damage costs also re-computed - see revised file on Roselyn in folder "G03G07"
